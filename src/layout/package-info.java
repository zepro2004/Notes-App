/**
 * User interface components and structure for the application.
 *
 * <p>This package contains the core UI framework of the application, implementing
 * a Swing-based desktop interface with a tabbed navigation pattern. It serves as the
 * presentation layer in the application's multi-tier architecture.</p>
 *
 * <p>Key components include:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link layout.MainLayout} - Primary container class that establishes the application
 *       frame, tabbed interface, and coordinates the initialization of UI components and services</li>
 *   <li>Subpackage {@link layout.panels} - Contains specialized UI panels for each functional domain</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Architecture:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The layout package implements the UI layer in the application's layered architecture</li>
 *   <li>It interacts with service layer components ({@link todo.impl.ToDoService},
 *       {@link notes.impl.NotesService}) through constructor injection</li>
 *   <li>The UI follows a modular design where functional areas are encapsulated in
 *       separate panels within the {@link layout.panels} subpackage</li>
 *   <li>Look and feel is provided by the Nimbus look and feel with consistent styling</li>
 *   <li>UI state is managed at the panel level, with each panel operating independently</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Implementation details:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The UI components use Swing's event-dispatching thread for thread safety</li>
 *   <li>Layout managers (primarily BorderLayout and GridBagLayout) are used for component organization</li>
 *   <li>Service dependencies are injected at construction time to support testability</li>
 *   <li>UI feedback is provided through standard dialog boxes and status indicators</li>
 *   <li>All user actions are validated before being passed to the service layer</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Design principles:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Separation of Concerns: UI is decoupled from business logic and data access</li>
 *   <li>Single Responsibility: Each panel focuses on one functional domain</li>
 *   <li>Dependency Inversion: UI components depend on service interfaces, not implementations</li>
 *   <li>Consistency: Common UI patterns are applied across all panels</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The MainLayout class establishes the application frame and coordinates initialization
 * of UI components, while specialized panels in the panels subpackage handle specific
 * domain functionality like todo list management and note-taking.</p>
