/**
 * UI components for specific functional areas of the application.
 *
 * <p>This package contains specialized Swing panel implementations that
 * serve as discrete functional units within the application's tabbed interface.
 * Each panel provides a complete user interface for a specific domain area,
 * encapsulating its own controls, layouts, and event handlers.</p>
 *
 * <p>Key components include:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link layout.panels.ToDoPanel} - Complete interface for creating, viewing, and managing todo tasks,
 *       including filtering, sorting, and status updates</li>
 *   <li>{@link layout.panels.NotesPanel} - Interface for creating, editing, and organizing text notes,
 *       with support for searching and categorization</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Architectural role:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>These panels represent the View layer in the application's architecture</li>
 *   <li>They translate domain operations into UI interactions and vice versa</li>
 *   <li>Each panel maintains its own UI state independent of other panels</li>
 *   <li>They communicate with the service layer through well-defined interfaces</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Implementation details:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Each panel follows the Observer pattern to respond to model changes</li>
 *   <li>UI components are arranged using a combination of BorderLayout and GridBagLayout</li>
 *   <li>Input validation occurs before delegating to service layer methods</li>
 *   <li>Common UI patterns like form submission, list selection, and error handling
 *       are consistently implemented across panels</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>These panels follow a consistent pattern where each:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Is instantiated by {@link layout.MainLayout} and added to the tabbed interface</li>
 *   <li>Receives its corresponding service component through constructor injection</li>
 *   <li>Operates independently with its own UI state and lifecycle</li>
 *   <li>Follows a consistent visual design language defined in the application</li>
 * </ul>
