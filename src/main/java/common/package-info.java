/**
 * Common components and utilities for the application.
 *
 * <p>This package provides common components, interfaces, and utilities
 * that are shared across different parts of the application. It serves as
 * a centralized location for cross-cutting concerns and reusable elements.</p>
 *
 * <p>Key components include:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Interfaces - Common service contracts in the {@link common.interfaces} subpackage
 *       that define consistent interaction patterns across application components</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Architectural role:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Provides shared abstractions that connect different application layers</li>
 *   <li>Defines common service contracts that enable loose coupling between components</li>
 *   <li>Acts as a neutral ground for interfaces that don't belong to specific domain areas</li>
 *   <li>Enables better testability through well-defined interface boundaries</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Implementation details:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Interfaces follow the Interface Segregation Principle with focused responsibilities</li>
 *   <li>Base classes provide common behavior that can be extended by domain-specific implementations</li>
 *   <li>Utilities employ static helper methods for commonly repeated operations</li>
 *   <li>Components are designed for maximum reusability across the application</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Design principles:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Dependency Inversion: High-level modules depend on abstractions defined here</li>
 *   <li>Interface Segregation: Interfaces are focused and client-specific</li>
 *   <li>Don't Repeat Yourself: Common functionality is centralized to avoid duplication</li>
 *   <li>Cohesion: Related functionality is grouped together logically</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This package may be extended in the future to include additional
 * common components such as utilities, validators, exceptions, and other
 * shared functionality.</p>
