/**
 * Implementation classes for todo services and management.
 *
 * <p>This package contains concrete implementations of the service interfaces
 * for managing ToDo items. These services provide business logic and mediate
 * between the UI components and data persistence layer, forming the core
 * implementation of the todo subsystem.</p>
 *
 * <p>Key components include:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link todo.impl.ToDoService} - Service implementation providing business logic
 *       for creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting todo items, along with operations
 *       like marking items as complete and filtering by priority or due date</li>
 *   <li>{@link todo.impl.ToDoDatabaseManager} - Data access component that implements
 *       {@link todo.interfaces.ToDoDatabaseManagement}, handling the persistence of todo items</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Architectural role:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>These implementations follow the Service Layer pattern in a multi-tier architecture</li>
 *   <li>Dependencies are injected through constructors following dependency inversion principles</li>
 *   <li>The service implementation orchestrates operations while maintaining business rules</li>
 *   <li>Clear separation is maintained between business logic and data access concerns</li>
 *   <li>Domain entities from the {@link todo} package are used as value objects throughout</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Implementation details:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Services implement transactional boundaries to maintain data integrity</li>
 *   <li>Thread safety is ensured through immutable objects and synchronized access where needed</li>
 *   <li>Performance optimizations include caching frequently accessed todo items</li>
 *   <li>Domain-specific exceptions provide clear error handling paths</li>
 * </ul>
