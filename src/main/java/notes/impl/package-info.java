/**
 * Implementation classes for the notes management system.
 *
 * <p>This package contains concrete implementations of the notes system interfaces,
 * providing the actual business logic and data access functionality. It forms the
 * core implementation layer of the notes subsystem within the application.</p>
 *
 * <p>Key components include:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link notes.impl.NotesService} - Service layer implementation that provides
 *       business logic for managing notes. This class handles operations such as creating,
 *       updating, retrieving, and deleting notes, while enforcing business rules.</li>
 *   <li>{@link notes.impl.NotesDatabaseManager} - Data access layer implementation of the
 *       {@link notes.interfaces.NotesDatabaseManagement} interface, responsible for
 *       persisting and retrieving notes from the database.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Architectural role:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>These implementations follow the dependency inversion principle, depending on
 *       abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations</li>
 *   <li>The {@link notes.impl.NotesService} receives its database dependency via constructor injection,
 *       improving testability and flexibility</li>
 *   <li>This package contains the concrete implementations that are instantiated by
 *       the {@link layout.MainLayout} during application initialization</li>
 *   <li>These implementations are isolated from UI concerns, maintaining clear
 *       separation between presentation and business logic</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Implementation details:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The {@link notes.impl.NotesService} maintains transaction integrity across operations</li>
 *   <li>The {@link notes.impl.NotesDatabaseManager} implements connection pooling for efficient database access</li>
 *   <li>All external exceptions are wrapped in domain-specific exceptions before propagation</li>
 *   <li>Implementations use defensive copying of mutable objects to maintain encapsulation</li>
 * </ul>
