/**
 * Interfaces defining the contracts for the notes management system.
 *
 * <p>This package contains interfaces that establish clear contracts between the different
 * layers of the notes subsystem, enabling loose coupling and facilitating the dependency
 * inversion principle. These interfaces define the operations and behaviors that concrete
 * implementations must provide without specifying how they are implemented.</p>
 *
 * <p>Key interfaces include:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link notes.interfaces.NotesDatabaseManagement} - Defines the contract for
 *       persistence operations on notes, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting
 *       notes in the data store. This interface is implemented by
 *       {@link notes.impl.NotesDatabaseManager} and used by {@link notes.impl.NotesService}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Architectural significance:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>These interfaces form the boundaries between architectural layers</li>
 *   <li>They enable dependency inversion, allowing high-level modules (services)
 *       to depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations</li>
 *   <li>This design facilitates unit testing through the use of mock implementations</li>
 *   <li>The interfaces provide a stable contract while allowing implementation details
 *       to evolve independently</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Design principles:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Interface Segregation Principle: Interfaces are focused and cohesive</li>
 *   <li>Single Responsibility Principle: Each interface addresses one aspect of functionality</li>
 *   <li>Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules depend on these abstractions</li>
 *   <li>Open/Closed Principle: New implementations can be added without modifying clients</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>These interfaces are instrumental in maintaining the clean separation between
 * the service layer and data access layer in the notes subsystem.</p>
